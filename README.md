# ACA-ML
A repository for the ACA project, done in 2015-16, my Sayash Kapoor and Kumar Kshitij Patel.

Work completed under this project :
- Read about various basic ML algorithms and techniques, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVMs, Neural Networks, Back-propagation, K-means clustering
- implemented 2 side projects: Sentiment analysis from movie reviews, and MNIST hand-wrtiting recognition
- Read papers about eigenfaces, PCA, Archetype analysis and SVD to gain a better understanding of how to implement face-recognition libraries

Code completed, studied and implemented:
- MNIST using SVMs
- MNIST using Neural Nets
- MNIST using linear regression on intensity
- Sentiment analysis of Movie reviews using Naive Bayes
- Naive Bayes
- Sentiment analysis using positive - negative word bag
- Stemming (NLTK Library)
- Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes
- Basic ML Algorithms, Andrew Ng
